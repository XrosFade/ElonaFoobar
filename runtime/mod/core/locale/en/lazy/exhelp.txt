Hi there, you must be the new face my folks were
talking about. 
Welcome to Irva, the era of Sierra Terre.
I'm Norne known as a guide. 
Helping you travelers is my job.

Here's my first tip for you.
Having too much stuff in your inventory burdens
you and <emp1>slows your actions.<def>
Use your home as a safe storage since the items 
dropped in your home won't disappear.

I heard some lazy guides are telling novices to 
read spellbooks in your home because <emp1>reading
a difficult book sometimes results in nasty
errors <def>which put you in danger like draining
your MPs or confusing you for a while.

...Don't trust them! 

Sometimes failure of reading also leads
devastating monsters to appear.
You don't want them smashing and breath-firing
on your valuable stuff in your house, don't you?

rate. And you can't use certain items and
skills in the world map. If you want to use

If you want to know more about the world map,
press ? to read the in-game help. The help
contains variety of useful information
throughout your journey.

Remember to stay on road as monsters are
weaker than those in the wilderness. And
occasionally, you will encounter wandering
merchants who will sell you quality but
expensive wears.

What a downpour! You shouldn't go outside
in bad weather. It will take you more time to
travel and even you may lose your way.

And did I tell you that you can seek shelter
in inns when in bad weather? Use the
opportunity wisely!

It's snowing outside! I'm excited!
But...Snow is tricky stuff for 
ravelers. Deep snow is difficult to walk
through. While there is snow on the
world map, it takes extra time to move
from place to place.

Fortunately, snow in North Tyris
doesn't last that long. You can usually
wait in one place and take it easy, and
eventually it will melt and you can
continue travel.

During poor weather conditions such
as this, the city inkeepers can bring
you to the town shelter. 
You should make good use of it.

Etherwind...
The wind is a serious problem. 
Exposed to the wind for a certain time,
you will mutate, and more importantly you
will start to be affected by the erosive
ether disease. 

The wilderness will be more dangerous
during the wind too. However, it is known
when this wind blows. It only spawns
<emp1>in a month multiples of 3 and<def>
<emp1>in days between 1-10. <def>
You really need to remember it.

Unlike with other bad weather, if the
ether wind is blowing when on the world map,
you can move faster than normal. If you can
somehow control mutation and the Ether Disease,
this wind might be actually useful to you.

During poor weather conditions such as this,
the city inkeepers can bring you to the
town shelter. You should make good use of it.

Here's a little explanation of shelters.
The town shelter is a safe place from
the ether wind. It's also a safe place
during thunderstorms and snow, too.

In the shelter time progresses dozens
of times faster than normal, and you will
automatically eat food supplies. 

Once the weather is back to normal,
time progresses normally again, and you
won't be able to eat food supplies.

At last, you are taken with the disease...
Don't be surprised, the corruption of
ether slowly advances over time si it
is very common in Irva.
Your symptom is still negligible small.

Disease progression is divided into
20 stages. As it progresses, your
condition becomes more fatal and may even
leads you to death eventually.

Don't worry! You have enough time to
deal with. Be warned though, Ether Wind
is different. It will significantly
worsen your disease. You should evacuate
when the wind spawns.
