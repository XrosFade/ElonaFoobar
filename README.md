# Elona foobar [![AppVeyor Build Status][appveyor-build-status-svg]][appveyor-build-status] [![Travis CI Build Status][travis-build-status-svg]][travis-build-status]

* One of the Elona variants.
* It is made of C++.
* It is derived from Elona v1.22.
* It is alpha version yet.
* It ~~has~~will have the highest extensibility with Lua. [####+]
* It ~~achieves~~will achieve truly internationalization. [####+]
* It works on multi-platform. [####+]


# How To Build

## Requirements

* `make`
* CMake 3.2 or later
* C++ compiler which supports C++14
* Boost
* Lua 5.3
* SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf and SDL2_mixer
* `clang-format`, `find` and `xargs`(Optional)

### Additional requirements for Windows

* Visual Studio 2017 x64
* 7-Zip or similar (for automated dependency extraction using `7z.exe`)
* `patch.exe` (for patching Lua with UTF-16 filename support. It comes with Git for Windows. Make sure it's on your path.)

### Additional requirements for Linux

* SMPEG
* Timidity++


## Steps

1. Extract `elona122.zip` (from [here](http://ylvania.style.coocan.jp/file/elona122.zip)) to the `deps` directory, so `deps\elona` exists. This will allow for automatically copying the required assets.
2. Follow the platform-specific instructions below.

### macOS

1. Install the required dependencies.
```
brew install cmake boost sdl2 sdl2_ttf sdl2_mixer sdl2_image lua
```
2. `cd path/to/Elona_foobar; make build`


### Linux

1. Install the required dependencies. For Arch Linux:
```
sudo pacman -S cmake sdl2 sdl2_ttf sdl2_image sdl2_mixer gtk3 smpeg lua boost timidity++
```
For systems with `apt`:
```
sudo apt-get install cmake liblua5.3-dev libboost-all-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev gtk+-3.0 smpeg timidity
```
2. `cd path/to/Elona_foobar; make build`


### Windows

1. Download and install the binaries for Boost `1.66` from [here](https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.66.0/binaries/boost_1_66_0-msvc-14.1-64.exe).
2. Edit `Makefile.win` to point to your Boost install directory.
3. Run `download.bat` inside the `deps` folder to download and extract the other dependencies to `deps\include`, `deps\lib` and `thirdparty\lib` (you have to have `7z.exe` and `patch.exe` on your `PATH`). This will also patch Lua for UTF-16 filename support.
4. Open the `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017`.
5. `cd path/to/Elona_foobar & nmake build -f Makefile.win`

To debug with Visual Studio, open `bin\Elona_foobar.sln`.


### Android

Building has only been tested on Linux so far.
1. Copy `android/local.properties.sample` to `android/local.properties` and edit it to point to your Android SDK and NDK installation paths.
2. `cd path/to/Elona_foobar; make android` (for release, run `make android_release`)

A standalone APK will be output in `bin/`.

By default, assets from vanilla Elona in `deps/` are not bundled with the APK, to respect the original content authors. To bundle these assets, pass the flag `-DANDROID_BUNDLE_ASSETS` to `cmake`. If original assets are not detected on startup, the app will prompt for the location of `elona122.zip`.

# How To Play

1. Copy the `data`, `graphic`, `sound` and `user` folders from vanilla v1.22 to the directory containing the executable. Make sure not to overwrite any files that already exist, as they have been updated in this version.
2. Execute `bin/Elona_foobar`, `bin/Elona_foobar.app` or `bin/Debug/Elona_foobar.exe`.
